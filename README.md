## tweetParsing -- Natural language analyzer applied to tweets

##### Content:
This repo contains a complete project that parses tweets unsing a simple natural language analyser.

##### Data-sets:T
The data used to build the project could not be uploaded to GitHub. This is due to proprietory restrictions on the distribution of its data by third parties imposed by Tweeter.  A snapshot of the data set is provided as well as a source, where similar can be downloaded. The downloaded data set may or may not be identical to the one originally used to obtain results presented here. The responsability for that falls squarely on the data maintainer at the source. In practice however, interested people may still benefit from the strategy laid out to build the project with similar data. 

##### Licensing terms and copyright:
Feel free to copy any material found here and to further release it to the general public, subject to the terms of the GNU General Public License v3... That license is not a right granted to you to plagiarize the content of the repo. Your editor, your university, your mother and common decency all have rules against that.  So do courts of law in most countries.  So use common sense and live happily ever after.

TLDR: *Basically the material on this repo is available for free (as in "free beer") as long as you always mention its authors by full name and you attach the above mentioned license's terms to it. You may not include it in other work, program, product or applications (commercial in nature or not) which do not comply with the GNU General Public License v3 or with something "very very very close".*  
Of course the above one sentence summary cannot be considered authoritative in terms of licensing.  It does not replace the GNU General Public License v3 included in this repo, which recoups the complete licensing terms for your reading pleasure. ;-)

The copyright however stays with me and with any contributors to this repo, according to who contributed what to the contents of the repo.
